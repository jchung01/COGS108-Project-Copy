      " It is well known that a nutritious diet is fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. In general, a nutritious diet provides us with sufficient energy, aids in the maintenance of a moderate weight, and even contributes to restful sleep (1). Furthermore, it has been shown to be one of the most effective modes of preventing certain non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and cancer. \n",
      " \n",
      " The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that non-communicable diseases are collectively responsible for the death of nearly 41 million people each year, which is equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally. 15 million of these people are between the ages of 30-69, with the majority of them occurring in both low- and middle-income countries (3). Besides the challenge that chronic disease poses to public health, they have also been shown to “exert a significant negative impact” on the economies of developing countries (2). The magnitude of this epidemic is alarming in consideration of the fact that the underlying risk factors, such as poor diet, tobacco use, consumption of alcohol, and physical inactivity, are largely preventable (3). It is imperative that countries take the necessary actions to promote methods of preventive care in order to contain the threat of this epidemic. Similarly, a report conducted by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed that “that nutrition should be placed at the forefront of public health policies and programmes” (4). In our project, we intend to analyze the relationship between the food groups prominent within a country's diet and their annual mortality rate from NCDs in order to inform their decision-making in regards to diet. In doing so, we hope to encourage readers to recognize the impact of their choices and the agency they have in determining the trajectory of their health.\n",

      "## **Background & Prior Research**\n",
      " \n",
      " As college students, most of us are not unfamiliar with the idea of dating whether we’ve experienced it first-hand or seen it with our friends and family. However, dating, itself, is not a universally shared experience as different people have different attributes for what they look for in a significant other. Some attributes include attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. \n",
      " \n",
      " In Western culture, dating is usually seen as a period where “people engage in informal and often polygamous relationships” [1] where people try to find someone that they deem fit and compatible enough to settle down with. Nevertheless, every dating experience is different since there are many variables that come into play when it comes to dating. So, we wanted to look more into how personal qualities affect one’s desirability as a potential partner and how attraction comes into play when similar interests or traits are introduced to one another. \n",
      " \n",
      " Most of the studies conducted to test attraction are well-controlled experiments which raises the concern for a lack of ecological validity [3, 4]. However, Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar’s speed dating experiment combats that concern. Their speed-dating scenario provides experimental control yet also gives data on decisions made in a setting that mimics real world scenarios [1]. Therefore, we decided to use data from their experiment as we deemed it was the best fit experiment for our research question. From other previous speed-dating studies, there’s been a consistent finding in how the strongest predictor of attraction was physical attractiveness which is seen across both sexes [3]. \n",
      " \n",
      " In our chosen study, researchers used fliers and emails to recruit students for the experiment. Trials took place during speed dating events held at popular restaurants near campus and to keep the environmental settings constant, trials at each location kept the same table arrangements, music, and lighting to reduce external factors from influencing outcomes. \n",
      " \n",
      " During the experiment, participants would rank certain attributes of their dates on paper and determine if they would be a match. Included in these attributes were attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, humor, ambition, and shared interests. Moreover, specific activities were laid out for participants to rank for interest such as sports, hiking, movies, and music. They also marked how important their partners’ race and religion were to them when deciding on being a match. All these factors helped researchers to uncover how individuals gauge if a person could be a suitable mate. They found that people do in fact have strong racial preferences when it comes to finding a partner even more so than having shared interests.\n",
      " \n",
      " In previous studies regarding dating preferences, physical attractiveness played a pivotal role in matching with a partner. Both men and women were found to value their partners’ appearance but there was no statistical significance in correlations for similarity of personalities and character traits [3]. This tells us that in dating, appearance is more important in a first impression than similarity. However, this does not mean that similarity is eliminated for initial romantic liking. According to one study, people do respond to perceived similarity in one another for attraction, but not to actual similarity [4]. For perceived notions of similarity, dates were more successful for individuals who expressed similar interests during the date itself. But when individuals completed personality trait assessments prior to the dates, the actual similarities between partners were lacking and did not lead to initial attraction. Based on this finding, similar interests and traits are not as important in finding a potential partner but do play a small part in initial attraction in addition to appearance.\n",
      " \n",
      " These research papers have led us to explore the idea of romantic attraction and how so many different variables come into play. Attraction is multi-dimensional and we want to study short-term and long-term to see if there’s a difference in attraction between people who are seeking ideal partners and people who aren’t necessarily looking to settle down yet. We believe that by exploring our research topic, we will have a better understanding of why certain dating preferences may exist. \n",
