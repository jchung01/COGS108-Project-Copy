This would include roughly 400 projects over 6 quarters. This data would be collected by webscraping COGS 108 project submission repositories, and either webscraping or parsing final submissions to find out what topic they focus on. We would store this data in a pandas dataframe object."

Our topic categories may not properly capture the full scope of the project and will be influenced by our own opinions since there is no way to objectively categorize these projects. Another bias that we will encounter is the issue of certain group submissions not existing in the COGS 108 repositories. For whatever reason this is, we cannot fully categorize every previous project submission."
